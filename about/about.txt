The first version of this plugin was based
on Doitsu's code for Sigil's ACE Plugin.
This is a simplified version.

It allows you to run ACE directly from the
Editor. Report opens on your default browser.

The Config Menu is based on KindleUnpack.

Thanks to Kovid Goyal for the help setting up
the Configuration Menu inside the Editor.
